**Auto Play-Pause YouTube Extension**
Overview
The Auto Play-Pause YouTube Extension automatically pauses YouTube videos when you switch tabs or windows and resumes when you return. It's especially useful for developers or learners who like to follow along with YouTube tutorials while simultaneously practicing in their code editors, like VS Code. No more manually pausing and playing videos when switching between your browser and code editor—this extension takes care of it!

Features
Automatic Pause and Play: Pauses the YouTube video when you leave the tab or window, and automatically resumes when you come back.
Seamless Learning Experience: Ideal for developers who are learning from YouTube tutorials while coding. You can focus on writing code without worrying about missing a part of the video.
Efficiency Boost: Minimizes distractions and helps you manage your learning and working environment more effectively.
How it Works
Install the extension in your browser.
Open a YouTube video.
The video will automatically pause when you switch to another tab or window (e.g., your code editor).
When you return to the YouTube tab, the video resumes playing from where it left off.
Why This Extension?
If you're a developer learning new concepts or tools from YouTube videos and practicing at the same time, this extension is a game-changer. No need to manually pause and play videos—it works automatically, giving you more time to focus on coding.
